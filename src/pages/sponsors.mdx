uORocketry, is a student run organization that runs almost exclusively through the generous support of our sponsors. We simply would not fly without these contributions. Your contributions are helping develop the future of the Canadian space industry and the development of exciting medical research. This fosters a creative, inventive environment where students are able to make and improve on their mistakes. Beyond that, your organization becomes part of our team. With ample opportunities to visit, frequent featuring on our social media platforms, and flying your logo on a sounding rocket, we make sure to further your brand.

## Technical Sponsors

We're always looking to see what new interesting technologies we can use for our mission! Partnering with the uOttawa Rocketry team allows for companies to test how their products apply in the realm of rocketry on a small scale.

Without the valuable donation of materials, components and expertise from industry sponsors, our team wouldn't be on the leading edge of performance.

If you are interested in our team, please feel free to reach out to us about working together!

Your donation helps create a collaborative environment where students are able to apply their studies out of the lecture hall, meet, and compete against students from around the globe!
